# Nimbus
A simple weather application built with Python, CustomTkinter, and the OpenWeatherMap API. This project is a learning experienceâ€”my first time working with APIs and my second time using CustomTkinter. The goal is to improve my skills in API integration, UI development, and become a better programmer overall.. <br>

Features<br>

  <b>Custom API Key Support:</b> Use the provided API key or configure your own.<br>
  <b>Current Weather:</b> Get real-time weather data for your city.<br>
  <b>Forecasts:</b> Check upcoming weather conditions.<br>
  <b>Temperature Units:</b> Display weather in either Fahrenheit or Celsius.<br>

How to Use Your Own API Key

  Create an account at OpenWeatherMap.<br>
  Navigate to "Your API Keys" in your account settings.<br>
  Replace the default key in the application with your own API key.<br>
